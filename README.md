Big thanks to startingelectronics.org 

In this example you can easily change HTML with e.g. Notepad++

Just be careful to not use )" in your HTML just insert a space ) ".
Otherwise the compiler thinks its the end of the R"( macro.

The strlen of HTML_CHAR about 6000 was no problem for my STM32F446-Nucleo board.
